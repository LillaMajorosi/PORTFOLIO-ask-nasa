The project

It was a team project.
The aim of this project was to build a website where we can ask datas from NASA api (https://api.nasa.gov/). We made it in React.

There is a CURRENT page, where you can see the today's daily data, after you click the planet. 
Below this section, you can find a calendar, where you can choose a date, which contains the data for the given day.

There is a GALLERY page, where you can choose a year. In the choosen year all days are shown. Click one picture and you can read the daily details.
